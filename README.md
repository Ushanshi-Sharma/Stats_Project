# Stats_Project
### This project aims to analyze NYC Taxi Trip Record using Statistics on Python and using different libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statmodels.


<br/>


## Data Overview
### For this analysis, we utilized the comprehensive dataset of NYC Taxi Trip records, used data cleaning and feature engineering procedures to concentrate solely on the relevant columns essential for our investigation.
#### • passenger_count (1 to 5)
#### • payment_type (card or cash)
#### • fare_amount
#### • trip_distance (miles)
#### • duration (minutes)

<br/>


## Problem Statement
#### In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most of revenue is essential for long-term success and driver happiness. Our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximise revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need. Our research aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount.



<br/>


## Objective
#### This project's main goal is to run an A/B test to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. We use Python hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract useful information that can help taxi drivers generate more cash. In particular, we want to find out if there is a big difference in the fares for those who pay with credit cards versus those who pay with cash.




<br/>


## Research Question
#### is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type and can we nudge customers towards payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers, without negatively impacting customer experience?


<br/>


## Hypothesis Testing result
#### With a T-statistic of 165.5 and a P-value of less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is indeed a significant difference in average fare between the two payment methods.


<br/>


## Recommendations
#### Encourage customers to pay with credit cards to capitalize on the potential for generating more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
#### Implement strategies such as offering incentives or discounts for credit card transactions to incentivize customers to choose this payment method.
#### Provide seamless and secure credit card payment options to enhance customer convenience and encourage adoption of this preferred payment method.
